JNIpp uses the power of C++ to give you better Java Native Interface.
It features wrappers for arrays and basic classes (Object, String),
exception translation, macros to simplify creation of your own wrappers
and more. [See help for details.](http://dmitryskiba.github.com/itoa-jnipp/)

JNIpp was developed as part of [Itoa project](https://github.com/DmitrySkiba/itoa)
